# 🧠 AI vs Human Text Detector

This project is a machine learning-based system designed to distinguish between text written by a **human** and that generated by an **AI language model** (e.g., ChatGPT). It uses deep learning and text embeddings to analyze writing patterns and classify them accurately.

---

## 📌 Features

- ✅ Binary classification: AI-generated vs Human-written text
- 📈 Achieved **92% accuracy** and **0.89 F1-Score**
- 🔍 Embedding + Deep Learning model
- 📊 Evaluation on real-world prompts and datasets
- 🧪 Trained and tested using clean, balanced samples

## 🚀 Live Demo (Optional)

🔗 **[Try it on Hugging Face Spaces](https://huggingface.co/spaces/SerialGuy/ai-vs-human)**  
(*Coming Soon — stay tuned!*)  
> Enter a piece of text and the model will predict whether it's written by an AI or a human.
